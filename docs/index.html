  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    This privacy policy explains how we handle and store your data when you use this browser extension.
  </p>

  <h4>Data Collection</h4>

  <p>
    The browser extension does not collect any personal information or data from you. We do not track your online activities, browsing history, or any personally identifiable information.
  </p>

  <h4>Data Storage</h4>

  <p>
    The extension uses OpenID Connect and OAuth2 to connect to third-party APIs. All the data used by the browser extension is stored within the extension storage API provided by the browser. This means that all data remains on your local computer and is not transmitted or shared with us or any third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    After logging in with your Google account, the application will fetch your email address, name, and YouTube subscriptions. This is the only user data related to your account which is stored. As mentioned, this data is only stored locally on your computer and in synced browser storage for your browser profile. This data is not transmitted or shared with us or any third parties.
  </p>

  <h4>Usage of Data</h4>

  <p>
    Since our extension does not store or transmit any data externally, we do not use your data externally for any purpose whatsoever. Your data is solely under your control and remains within your browser's extension storage. Data such as your name and email address are only used to show you which account is currently linked on the extension. All other data, namely your followed channels, are only used to list your followed channels on the extension, which is core functionality of the extension.
  </p>

  <h4>Data Security</h4>

  <p>
    We have implemented appropriate technical measures to safeguard the data stored within the browser extension. However, please note that your access tokens will be stored unencrypted on your local computer, so the data is only as safe as your computer is.
  </p>

  <h4>Google Limited Use Policy</h4>

  <p>
    This application complies with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements. The Limited Use requirements ensure that the application has appropriate access, limited use, and secure data handling.
  </p>

  <h4>Contact Information</h4>

  <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy or the browser extension, please create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/mikeyaworski/Twitch-Lurker/issues">Issues tab</a>.
